"""
The encryption and decryption process [with symmetric encryption] is
generally faster than with asymmetric encryption, but key distribution
can be difficult.
"""

From p. 400
"""
Asymmetric ciphers tend to be quite a bit slower than symmetric ciphers.
"""

From p. 406
"""
A hybrid cryptosystem gets the best of both worlds. An asymmetric cipher
is used to exchange a randomly generated key that is used to encrypt the
remaining communications with a symmetric cipher. This provides the
speed and efficiency of a symmetric cipher, while solving the dilemma of
secure key exchange. Hybrid ciphers are used by most modern cryptographic
applications, such as SSL, SSH, and PGP.
