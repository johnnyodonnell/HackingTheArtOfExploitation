 * Using this program to see if the address of `strcpy` changes during
 * consecutive runs.
 *
 * This needs to be compiled like so:
 * ```
 * gcc -fno-builtin -g char_array2.c
 * ```
 * Otherwise, the `strcpy` will be optimized out of the compiled program.

 *
 * I had to use the `step` command in gdb to view the `strcpy`
 * assembly instructions and to see the `strcpy` address.
 *
 * The text on p.41 seems to indicate that the `strcpy` address should
 * change between consecutive runs. However, despite running this program
 * multiple times in gdb, the `strcpy` address is always the same.
 * The address shown in the text from the example output also does
 * not change on consecutive runs.
