Q:

At which level is the call stack implemented?

Is the implemented by the processor, the operating system, or the
programming language?

A:

It seems that the call stack model was first implemented by programming
languages with no support from hardware. Then, hardware followed suit and
supported the call stack model in order to support the growing number of
programming langauges that used the call stack model.

It sounds like you could even use a different model than the call stack model
on hardware that has support for the call stack model.
